## Technology Stack

The Guess My Number game is developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML:** The game's structure and layout are defined using HTML, providing the foundation for the web page.

- **CSS:** Styling is applied through CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design. The game features animations and gradients to enhance the user interface.

- **JavaScript:** The game's logic and interactivity are implemented with JavaScript. The random generation of the target number, handling user input, providing feedback, and managing the game state are all facilitated by JavaScript.

- **Fonts:** The game utilizes the 'Press Start 2P' font from Google Fonts to evoke a retro and playful aesthetic, enhancing the overall theme.

- **Images and GIFs:** Background images and GIFs are used to provide visual appeal and a dynamic backdrop to the game. These include 'Dance.gif', 'Wrong.gif', and 'Black.gif'.

- **Audio:** An audio file ('Monkeys-Spinning-Monkeys.mp3') is embedded using the `<embed>` tag to add an auditory element to the gaming experience.

The combination of these technologies results in an engaging and interactive number guessing game with a minimalist design.
